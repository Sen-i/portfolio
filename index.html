			<h1>Hello There</h1>
			<h3>Welcome to my world!</h3>
			<p>A short description of my world as a nation can be given here. It's a world with only slightly higher tech, due to the general resources scarcity of the place. There are many land-based colonies, like a few settlements in the southeastern half. Like most. Every single one of these is too small to be considered a nation, but they are still human sized. And they're all just child to me.The geography is mountainous, but there's also a lot of forests, thanks to the many mines spread out around the country. I have also personally researched the science of forest, and it's the second to best one.And this is the old map, and the one I've gotten myself from</p>

						<h3>Vincent Pires</h3>
							<p>It's time to reveal the face of the magician who created this website, and when the lie was complete, the magician who has brought to light the truth, master of the evil spirit. This site was designed by the magician in conjunction with the phoenix who was still alive at that time it's common that the master of the evil spirit has to die to complete the ritual. That's why the phoenix wanted to sacrifice the magician to be reborn as a phoenix but ,It didn't have the luxury of just sacrificing the magician the other people involved also had to die. The phoenix and the magician would never ever encounter each other again. This was a true life death.</p>
